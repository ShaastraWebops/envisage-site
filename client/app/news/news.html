      <h3>6 Editions . 7 Shows . 5000 People</h3>
      <p>The Annual Technical Festival of IIT Madras, Shaastra introduced a technologically aided cultural show in the year 2013, capitalizing on the entertainment factor. That techno – cultural show was named Envisage and today it is India’s first and only student organised techno-entertainment show.
          
          The projects which were exhibited in former editions of Envisage attracted a bunch of not-so-technically oriented guests too. The projects were designed in conformity with the tagline of Envisage – “Technology meets Entertainment”. Organisers of Envisage decided to widen its boundaries beyond Shaastra and founded a club under CFI. The club is known as Techno-Entertainment Club and has been functional for the past one year.

<h4>Five Years of Existence</h4>
<p>
          
          
          Envisage is the jewel in the crown that is Shaastra. It remains the only student-orchestrated technical show in its domain and is among the spectacles that Shaastra produces every year. 
          
          Envisage entail a series of techno-entertainment performances involving a tantalizing synchronization of the lights and sound. Through projects such as Free Illusion, Virtual Instruments, Water-Fall and Wiremap, Envisage has mesmerized audience over the five years of its existence. From our sponsors to media persons, and students to event panelists, plenty have been wowed by the sparkling event, and it is therefore not a surprise that the show has been run twice to accommodate the crowds that amass at the show arena for the performances.
          
          Envisage has played host to audiences sizes of 5000 for 7 shows in six successful editions. These are unprecedented numbers for a show that boasts to be one of its kind in the country.
